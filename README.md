# Generate and Optimise Model on Forex Data
Generate and optimise models using Tensorflow and TensorBoard on Forex Data.
The supplied raw data was pulled using Oanada API and is the GBP/USD 4hr timeframe series.
Use a loop function to iterate of the model create to find the best setting use to create a model on this dataset. The results
were then compared with tensorboard.
The next step is to create algorithm that uses the model to make trades on the live market to
valid its preformance.
